Doing problems in various languages is fun.  I started doing the 99 lisp problems (available at http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) in lisp and haskell, then I decided to do it in a bunch of languages, after which I decided that would take too long and only did lisp for a while.  I'm not done -- after getting half way through I suddenly had less free time, and other things became priorities.  However, I want to work on them some more and am putting it on github so I can access it easily from, say, behind a proxy where I can reach github but not my personal server.

As a side note, this was a wonderful project to be working on at the same time as I switched from vim to emacs.  At the times of greatest activity for this repo, I think my dotfiles repo had probably twice as much as I was hacking at my elisp configuration to make emacs sane (which by default it is not...).
